    "NOTE: I'm providing a 3 implementations below with increasing complexity because if you only use the standard circuit that gives you p(0) = cos²(π·α), there’s an inherent ambiguity. This function is symmetric, meaning it can’t distinguish between α and 1 – α. The circuit “sees” only the effective phase modulo 1, and for any measurement you get two possible α values (one in [0, 0.5] and its complement in [0.5, 1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this ambiguity and find α uniquely, one would need to add an additional measurement that can capture the sign (or full phase) information. One approach is to perform an extra measurement—such as a tomography-like measurement that obtains the expectation values of both Pauli‑X and Pauli‑Y on the control qubit—to reconstruct the full phase unambiguously."
